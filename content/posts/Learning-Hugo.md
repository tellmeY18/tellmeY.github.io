Vaccation season is here and I've seen my peers posting their memmories as blog posts in various platforms. Journaling was something that was in the list of things to do for me this year and as almost everything else I struggled with consistency and had to let go of journaling in mastodon halfway. Blogs are usually fun read and the good ones will never bore you with depressing content. The primary AIM of setting up this blog post is to make me familiarise with the set of tools a devoloper should be having. I heard about Hugo from [cliford](https://cliford.net/) and yea thanks to [Pavi's](https://pavithra.dev/) I'm linking the name's to their respective websites. (or did she link em to linkedin ?). So as this is the first post and I'm unsure if anyone else except me will actually read this somewhere I'm concluding the first entry.\
PS: I used the Official [HUGO Documentation](https://gohugo.io/categories/getting-started) and a [Markdown Cheatsheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/) to create this entry.\
 You can see the wm setup and the tools i used to draft this post.

Final thought as i've finalised the hugo setup and is almost ready to deploy it with the help of [AIM](https://aravindim.github.io/) The Hugo themes have more importance than i've initially thought and I've settled for a minimal one which is the Hugo-awesome-blog I tried Blowfish and ananke. Hopefully I'll familiarise with more themes down the road.
