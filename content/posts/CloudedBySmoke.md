The fact that today marks the beginning of the academic year has no influence on my decision to write this now. Unlike my past attempts to establish habits for consistency, I am well aware that I won't be writing again anytime soon. I've struggled with maintaining consistency in anything productive, often feeling that I have a short attention span and find it challenging to sustain efforts for tasks that require consistency. Recognizing this trait, I devised a foolproof plan to keep myself in check. The key was to avoid falling into harmful habits like drinking and smoking, which are quite common. Surprisingly, this approach worked, perhaps due to sheer willpower or smartly leveraging my inherent laziness to avoid falling into addiction.

Resisting temptations, especially under peer pressure on campus, was not easy. I must confess that I occasionally enjoyed participating in drinking circles and passive smoking to be part of social interactions during other's moments of euphoria. Now, the reason I started writing this post is because of two recent emails. One was from a concerned junior who fears the health risks of passive smoking, and the other was an unusually quick response from the DSW regarding this matter.

However, the reality of substance addiction, including smoking, differs significantly from what is written on paper. I won't touch upon other narcotics here to keep this short. Tobacco is widely used and highly addictive across various age groups. Quitting smoking is challenging, and not many have a success story to share. It involves enduring withdrawal symptoms, mental and physical pain, only to fall back into the habit during moments of weakness. That's the harsh reality of smoking. I've had many discussions with friends, both smokers and non-smokers, about its social and psychological impact.

The administrative response to the smoking issue has been inadequate. Despite claiming a 100% smoke-free campus, the reality is quite different. Those tasked with enforcing the Smoke-Free law are often smokers themselves and choose to overlook students smoking in their rooms. Smoking has become normalized in society, making strict actions difficult. Increasing scrutiny and imposing fines on students caught smoking might drive smoking underground, leading to more harmful behaviors which include more potent drugs that leaves lesser trace to others.

Moving on to a solution, the first step should be to anonymously collect data on smokers and non-smokers in campus, prioritizing privacy. Acknowledging the significant number of smokers, efforts should be made to provide support. Creating designated smoking areas, while legally challenging, can be beneficial in helping addicts on the path to quitting. Such areas should be well-ventilated and display helpline numbers and success stories of those who quit. Offering a safe space for smokers can promote the idea that help is readily available.

I realize this plan may sound like an Utopian dream, but the current measures are far from perfect and will likely cause more pain and loss in the long run. Instead of witch-hunting smokers, providing support and understanding can lead to more positive outcomes.

The fact that today was the first academic day had nothing to do with me writing this now and unlike previous attempts to start some habit to work on my consistency I'm very well aware that I won't be writing anytime too soon about anything here. I've had hard time being consistent on anything fruitful I've felt that I had a very short attention span and had trouble with tasks that required consistent efforts. A I've realised that this is one of a trait as soon as I understood about it I made a foolproof plan to keep myself at check. The key was to not slide into any of them ill habits drinking and smoking being the common ones. Surprisingly It did work and idk if it's all just will power or me intelligently relying on my absoloute lazyness to start doing something bad that kept me sober. 

It was no easy resisting the temptations especially the peer pressure you have to face in campus. I have to confess that i did enjoy the drinking circles and the passive smoking just so that I could be part of the conversation and form a social bond at their point of euphoria. Coming to the topic The reason I started scribbling this post is because of 2 mails that were sent a while back. One from one of my fellow junior who is terrified of dying from cancer or any other respiratory illness due to passive smoking (which by no doubt is a serious concern) and the reply mail by the DSW which was unusually fast more like thunder after a lightning compared to the usually awaited rainbow that might or might not show up. 

However beyond the flashing rules that are on paper, reality about substance addiction including smoking, Is quite different. I'm not gonna touch the topic of other narcotics 'cause I intend to keep this short and not dive into the details. Tobacco is one of the widely used intoxicant that has high usage among almost all age categories. It's undoubtfully very addictive and not many share the "GOOD STORY" about quitting smokiking. Days marking calender enduring hard withdrawal symptoms, mental and physical pain that too all just to again fall back right into a moment of weakness. And that is the reality of smoking. I've had a fair amount of discussion about smoking it's social and psychological reasons and impacts with friends that smoke frequently and those who absoloutely despise smoking. 

The admin Have had always been lost in smoke when it comes to addressing the smoking issue. The statements that I'm about to make in the wollowing sentence might sound blasphamous but read it full and idk comment your thoughts? 

Keeping in mind the reality of quitting smoking is quite treacherous and takes immense amount of will power Let's see what other facts are at play here. after every student suicide or whenever something bad happens the term SGC always comes up. It stays in discussion for a week or two and then is then again forgotten of it's existence. Last I checked the Website of SGC is still kept unmaintained from 2015 and facilities such as conselling still is considered taboo and fruitful efforts are not being made by anyone to bridge the gap. The infrastructure for counselling remains very low to accomodate the student needs and Addicts are repelled away with the societial norms that are already there. The effects of tobacco commercial that were a thing pre 2000s and the forever romantisization of smoking in various mass consumed medias and to a point fear of alienation from parents coupled with unexplained "NO" only lead many teens to the habbit of smoking. while the people in first category may smoke without fear in the open not concerned of what other may think the later often keep their pleasure with nicotine a secret. unknown to even the closest family members leaving them vulnerable to be fully addicted. 

The "BAN" on tobacco in campus grounds is no different. By claiming campus 100% smoking free the admin has blinded themselves from the reality. Not pointing fingers but people who are supposed to enforce the Smoke-Free law are also mostly victims to the habbit of smoking, and often really choose to ignore students smoking in their rooms because it is already deeprooted in the society that smoking is something normal. The effort to take strict actions to tackle the problem at hand won't be an easy solution either. Chances are we will see an increased scrutity interms of checking inside campus for smoking, Which might even result in imposing fines over the students that are caught. Such actions are likely to force students to do continue smoking more in secret (which at first might appear to be a win against passive smoking) which might lead them to even more hazardous intoxicants that will harm them further.

Stopping abruptly from the long list of issues related to smoking I'll move on to the solution that even though might sound ridiculous that will actually have positive impact on students in a whole. 

The first step is to anonymously collect the data from the students with highest priority given to privacy to obtain the demographics of smokers and non smokers in campus. External help can be utilized for the collection of the same to have more expertise. Open your eyes to the reality that majority (I'd be confident to say that around 70% or more)  of the students are active smokers with different range of addiction.

With acknowleging that such amount of students are addicted and their deaddiction is a long journey the next step should be to ensure support reaches them. For an average hosteller smoking be it inside campus premises or outside the campus premises is both illegal. Smoking still exists in Public spaces in India. Often many times students are fined by the police in their patrol. Sure the fine might not be as high as the one EXTORTED by the admin. But still by advising students to smoke somewhere else is still encouraging them to break the law. 

As a solution efforts must be made by the admin to ensure that a safe space is provided to the Addicts to smoke in a remote space that is ventilated and will not cause discomfort of passive smoking. I do realise there are laws that might challenge setting up such areas close to educational instituitions but the benifits of having such spaces outweights the harm and discussions should be initiated to overcome those legal challenges. 

Of the many benifits that we'll be able to achive that includes putting an end to passive smoking having such smoking areas will be crucial to help the addicts on a path to quit smoking. Often It is at the right moment after the last puff taken The regret of smoking reaches the deepest point and It is at that moment majority of the smokers feel they should quit. By leading a witchhunt on smokers the admin will only force the students to cultivate fear and thereby resistance and at cases only results in devoloping a sense of adventure in breaking the rules.

The smoking area should Display The helpline numbers and experience from those who quit smoking etc and make the addicts feel that help is not far but as close as it can ever get. The plan might sound very utopic and a fairyland come true kinda story. But the alternative measures that we were following and are destined to follow is nowhere close to perfect and will cause more pain and loss on a longer run.
