What better way to celebrate the Hacker culture than to build something that you love overnight. Me and [afraz](https://www.linkedin.com/in/afraz-ahmed-173b25223/) visited the [TinkerSpace](https://www.tinkerhub.org/tinkerspace) back when we went to attend the [Debutsav](https://kochi.debutsav.in/), [AIM]() and I spent sometime later on the hackerspace when he came to attend the Kochi foss monthly meetup. We both registered our names there and I got to know about their [Saturday Hacknight](https://hacknight.tinkerhub.org/). I really liked their Idea and wanted to implement the same for NITC. And the right next fosscell meet we had the idea became topic of discussion and the FOSSCell advisor [Prof. Rakesh]() also liked the idea of having a hackathon. He helped us secure  funding from the [IIC](https://nitc.ac.in/institution-innovation-council) which helped us serve tasty üçï to the Hac'ers. The event participation was very good for the first edition  of the event. They were provided a week to create a repo and build a readme that describes what  they're building. And they were called to SSL to build it overnight. You can checkout the [FOSSCell Newsletter](https://newsletter.fosscell.org/post/fridaynightfoss/) for more details.
